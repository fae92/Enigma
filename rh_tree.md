Recently our company has grown big and it looks like it's often hard to find a manager that is common for two of the employees. Decision making process is taking longer than expected because of that. Therefore HR 
come up with a request to IT - they want a functionality that will allow them to easily identify a manager that is the lowest in the hierarchy and yet common for two employees.


You can assume that the hierarchy in company is in the form of a tree, meaning that everyone has exactly one manager (except of our CEO Tom, who is his own manager). Below there is a small extract from the structure of our company:


Tom is manager of Mary
Mary is manager of Bob
Mary is manager of Sam
Bob is manager of John
Sam is manager of Pete
Sam is manager of Katie


How can you provide the functionality asked by HR?
